# Stringency Index



The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides a transparent, real-time monitoring system that allows comparison of government measures between countries (Hale et al. 2020). In order to account for the variation in containment and closure policies at national level, we used the Stringency Index (Index methodology version 3.1). This index is an additive score of nine policy decision indicators, rescaled to vary from 0 to 100, which records the strictness of the lockdown measures per country. A global average of the Stringency Index indicated that April was the month with the strictest measures experienced across all available coastal countries (n = 133).
